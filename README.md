# Loan-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

The proposed model focuses on predicting the credibility of customers for loan
repayment by analyzing their behavior. The input to the model is the customer
behavior collected. On the output from the classifier, decision on whether to approve
or reject the customer request can be made. Using different data analytics tools, loan
prediction and their severity can be forecasted. In this process, it is required to train
the data using different algorithms and then compare user data with trained data to
predict the nature of loan. To extract patterns from a common loan approved dataset,Loan Prediction using Machine Learning

and then build a model based on these extracted patterns. The training data set is
now supplied to machine learning model; on the basis of this dataset the model is
trained. Every new applicant detail filled at the time of application form acts as a test
data set. After the operation of testing, model predict whether the new applicant is a
fit case for approval of the loan or not based upon the inference it concludes on the
basis of the training data sets. To extract important information and predict if a
customer would be able to repay his loan or not. Machine Learning (ML) techniques
are very useful in predicting outcomes for large amount of data. In this project, four
machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), Random
Forest (RF) and XGBoost are applied to predict the loan approval of customers.
